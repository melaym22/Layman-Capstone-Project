## Preliminary Data Analysis- Linear Regression

CAPDAP "Rough Draft" Project 11/22/2024

In this document, I will explore the relationship between chlorophyll and temperature from the data file "CAPDAP_WC_4Analysis.csv."

I will use the following workflow model: plot data (and guess the results) → build the statistical model → Check the model assumptions → Interpret the model → Make a final plot

starting with a clean environment and package installation

```{r}
rm (list = ls())
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(ggfortify)
library(multcomp)
```

next, I'll read in the data

```{r}
WC<- read.csv(here("data", "CAPDAP_WC_4Analysis.csv"))
```

then I'll alter necessary data types

```{r}
WC$Site_Type <- as.factor(WC$Site_Type)
WC$Date<-ymd(WC$Date)
WC$Time<-hms(WC$Time)
```

My null hypothesis is that there is no relationship between chlorophyll and temperature in my Water Chestnut data.

To test this, I'll first plot this proposed relationship (two continutous variables) using a scatterplot, and will later run a linear regression.

```{r}
ggplot(WC,aes(x=Temperature,y=Chlorophyll))+
  geom_point()+
  theme_bw()
```

There appears to be a strong positive relationship, indicating that as temperature increases, so does chlorophyll.

(The rise values can be mapped as (29.3-23) and the run as (5.2-1.8). M=6.3/3.4 or 1.85, so I estimate the slope to be \~1.85 and the y intercept to be around 19.5.

Next, I'll build my statistical model. Since I'm going to run a linear regression, I'll need to start with a model

```{r}
WCmodel <- lm(Temperature~Chlorophyll, data=WC)
WCmodel
```

So, here the slope is 1.733 and the y-int is 19.728. My guesses weren't too far off.

I'll need to check my assumptions before running any tests

```{r}
autoplot(WCmodel)
```

Reviewing these charts, I would conclude:

RvFit model - a little wave, but overall a linear model is likely appropriate

Normal Q-Q - looks good, pretty normal data fit to this line

Scale Location - this is a bit concerning, it indicates that there is an unevenness in the residuals

RvLeverage - There may be a few points with larger leverage here.

Overall, I will review this with Erika, but I'm going to proceed anyways.

I can move onto my tests

```{r}
anova(WCmodel)
```

Here I see that there is a significant association between temperature and chlorphyll.

Let's dig in further.

```{r}
summary(WCmodel)
```

From this I see that the y-intercept is 19.7281 and the slope is 1.7325. The adjusted R2 is 0.3769, which means that about 37.69% of the variation in chlorophyll is associated with temperature (pretty good for a field test).

#### Final plot

Let's get a nicer looking plot

```{r}
ggplot(WC, aes(Temperature, Chlorophyll))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")+
  ggtitle("Comparing Temp and Chl in Water Chestnut")+
  labs(x = "Temperature in Degrees Celsius", y = "Chlorophyll (μg/L)")+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(
    axis.title.x=element_text(colour="blue", size=rel(1)), # adjust colour and size of x-axis title
    axis.title.y=element_text(colour="darkgreen", size=rel(1)), # adjust colour and size of x-axis title
      )
```

##### Results statement

There is a statistically significant and positive association between tail length and body length in bats (F~1, 295~ = 180.01, p = \<\<\< 0.001, R^2^ = 0.3769).
